Use "Virtual Box"(TM) by Oracle(TM) to use this VM.

-added neccessary permessions for htdocs folder, ontologies files (chmod 777)


How to start project (short version):

	-`cd /home/user/workspace/Ontology`
	-git pull

-make sure that your ontologies files have right permissions (they should be writable for ftp client of Agent)
-change all URLs (varaibles <internalOnt> and <ftpURL> especially in class <MyCognitiveAgent>) to ontologies (in VM in should be like http://user-virtualbox/...)

Note:
-Stop Jade only by pressing: File - Shut down Agent Platform
(else you have to stop java process in system monitor)
-I recommend to have 2 GB of RAM and 2 cores for the VM
